In this repository:
* You are currently viewing the **Awesome Industrial Protocols** page.
* Detailed pages for protocols are available in `protocols`.
* All data is stored in MongoDB databases in `db`.
* **Turn/IP** (in `srcs`) is a handy tool to manipulate this data, generate the
  awesome list and protocol pages, and simplify the research and test process
  on industrial protocols.

> Note: Sometimes it is unclear whether a name refers to a protocol, a standard,
  or a complete environment, or if a protocol on a serial link can be accessed
  in any way from the Ethernet link (through a dedicated implementation or a
  gateway). I apologize for any confusion, and of course, I welcome any remarks
  or contributions.
